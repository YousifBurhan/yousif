<p id="yousif"> I'm Yousif Burhan, and it's my pleasure to introduce myself. I was born in Eritea and grew up . I did
                the basic introduction of ICT and have finished my GCSE maths and Level ONE English fanctinal skills.
                My strength is that I am always ready to take up new challenges and strive for excellence. This is
                because I believe success and failures are the best way to sculpt ourselves to reach our goals. And I
                believe in myself and my hard work, and I want fulfillment in everything.

                My short-term goal is to achieve excellence in the skills I'm mastering, take up a challenge in some
                good organizations, and climb the ladder of success. However, my long-term goal is to be a renowned
                technical engineer in an organization and climb the ladder of success. However, my long-term goal is to
                be a renowned technical engineer in an organization and reach the highest level of success.

 <p> My strongest attribute is my determination. I take on every challenge head-on and do what I need to accomplish my goals, even when the challenge is difficult. Every time that I was given a new challenge at my previous job, whether it was leading my first team project or meeting a quick deadline, I always enjoyed stepping up and demonstrating skill at that new task.
